# Madri-GLES

This project is about a PC emulation of Android's Java OpenGL ES
Now hosted at GitHub

Goal : Port android.opengl package to PC environment, to help development of portable OpenGL ES applications 
across several platforms supporting Java language.

It uses Google's ANGLE OpenGL ES 2.0 emulator and PowerVR Emulation OpenGL-ES libs.

Platforms to be supported (Native libs) :

1 - Windows 7 and up - x86 & x64

2 - Linux x86 & x64

3 - Android, with backport of this API (fixing some issues with original Android GLES API)

4 - OSX - only with some sponsoring.
